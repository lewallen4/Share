🧠 Conceptually

OPA = Policy decision point (PDP)
Your system = Policy enforcement point (PEP)

OPA evaluates a policy and returns a result like { "result": true }.

Your system (or workflow, or daemon, or API gateway) interprets that result and decides what to do — e.g.:

Allow the request.

Deny access.

Log and alert.

Shut down a process.

Trigger a remediation workflow.

OPA itself won’t terminate a server, restart services, or block a user; it’s deliberately designed to be side-effect-free so it can be used safely anywhere.

⚙️ Example interactions

Here are a few realistic integration modes:

1. OPA in CI/CD (policy gate)

Used like Sentinel in Terraform.

You run opa eval or POST /v1/data/policy/allow before applying infra.

If the result is false → the pipeline fails.

If true → continue.

👉 Outcome: Stops bad infrastructure before deployment, but doesn’t affect runtime servers.

2. OPA in a running service (sidecar or middleware)

Used in microservices, Kubernetes admission controllers, or custom APIs.

A request comes in → your service asks OPA “Can user X do Y?”

If false → the service returns HTTP 403 or denies the request.

If true → it proceeds.

👉 Outcome: OPA enforces live access control, but your service handles the response.

3. OPA monitoring or alerting mode

If you just want to observe or alert:

Run OPA continuously with a watcher (e.g., curl or Prometheus exporter).

Query periodically and write to logs / Splunk / Slack.
